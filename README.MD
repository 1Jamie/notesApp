# Basic notes app
The whole thing with this app is i wanted to make a basic note taking app that i can use to help me keep track of things
it has a bit more functionality than it probably should, like multiple users and cookie based authentication

## what works? 
    - ...Well thats a trick question, this has just been whipped up in the last day or so...
    Right now i have the database built (need to add the dump for other to be able to get it running easily also)
    - User authentication works for sign in
    - Once signed in as long as you dont close the browser there is a cookie that will auto log you in if you have been on the page in less than 30 minutes
    if not it makes you sign in again

## what is about to work?
    - well im trying my best to get the example note in the databse to display nicely
    - from there im gonna work on getting new entries into the database from a text field
    - toggle to let you know if you have delt with it
    - marked what time the note was taken and sort it by such
    - navigation of the notes in a list via day
    - not sure... i tend to come up with features as i go...
